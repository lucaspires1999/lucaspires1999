<p align="left">Starting in 2019, I worked as a technical analyst at TIVIT for two and a half years. During this time, I worked with the SLA Definition artifact - ServiceNow, and the Power BI platform - Microsoft. With this challenge, I was able to contribute to the automation of the calculation of contractual indicators, which had a positive impact on the client by freeing up time so that the business area could finally have a strategic vision. We were able to automate around 90% of the business process, enabling real-time calculation and predicting possible breaches of contractual indicators in advance.<br><br>In 2021, I joined Capgemini as a technical leader, where my focus has been on the architecture of applications using the App Engine artifact - ServiceNow platform. In this role, I have been able to contribute to the positive impact on the customer in their digital transformation efforts, which includes migrating their shadow IT applications to the cloud while ensuring compliance, as well as creating new strategic applications for the business areas. I actively participated as an architect in approximately 10 out of the more than 150 applications that were put into production for this project.</p>
